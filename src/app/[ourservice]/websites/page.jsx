          Think you're too local to need a website? Think again. In 2025, even neighborhood businesses are being Googled before they’re visited. Whether you run a salon in Soweto, a plumbing service in Durban, or a law firm in Cape Town — a clean, fast, mobile-ready website is no longer optional. It's where first impressions are made, trust is built, and leads are captured. A website lets you show up when people search for your service, explain what makes you different, and prove you're legit.
