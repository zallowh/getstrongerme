          Steps to Choose the Right Digital Marketing Agency in 2025
        </h2>
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-3 mt-4">
          <li>
            <strong>Start with Clear Business Goals:</strong> Define what you want to achieve—whether it’s improving SEO rankings, running effective PPC campaigns, boosting social media engagement, or building brand awareness. A good agency will tailor their approach to your specific objectives rather than offering generic packages.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Evaluate Expertise and Experience:</strong> Look for agencies with proven experience in your industry or with similar businesses. Review their portfolio, case studies, and client testimonials to verify their track record. Agencies recognized with awards or certifications (e.g., Google Partner) signal credibility.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Understand Their Service Offering:</strong> Choose between full-service agencies that handle SEO, PPC, social media, content marketing, and analytics, or specialized agencies focused on your priority channels. Ensure their services match your needs and can scale with your business.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Review Their Process and Transparency:</strong> An ideal agency should clearly explain their strategies, methodologies, reporting frequency, and pricing structure. Transparency about how they measure success and communicate progress is essential to avoid surprises.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Assess Team Quality and Fit:</strong> Ask about the team members who will manage your account, their expertise, and workload. Cultural fit and communication style matter for a smooth partnership. Local agencies or those with good time zone overlap can facilitate better collaboration.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Check Use of AI and Data-Driven Approaches:</strong> In 2025, agencies leveraging AI tools for audience targeting, automation, and analytics tend to deliver superior results. They should base decisions on data insights rather than guesswork.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Verify Reviews and Reputation:</strong> Look for genuine client reviews on independent platforms and ask for references. Positive feedback and case studies demonstrating measurable results are strong indicators of reliability.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Consider Pricing and Value:</strong> Compare pricing models but focus on value rather than just cost. The cheapest option may not deliver results, while the most expensive isn’t always best. Look for flexible contracts that allow scaling services as your needs evolve.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ensure Account and Data Ownership:</strong> Confirm that you will retain full ownership and access to your marketing accounts and data. This protects your assets and ensures transparency.
          </li>
